      <h3>The company</h3>

      <p>
        BRICKX gives solutions for those people who wants to invest in real estates bit by bit. In fact it offers a real estate sharing market where people can buy and sell only parts of the properties.<br/>
        This is because each property is bought and the value divided into 10 thousand parts, which are the shares that users are going to own. They will resell them when is more convenient to other users of the platform.<br/>
        Every owner gets a monthly revenue based on the amount of shares they own.<br/>
        The whole system works quite well especially in a situation like Sydney where there is a constant inflation of property prices.
